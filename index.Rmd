Hello! My name is Mindy. I am currently pursuing my Masters of Public Health at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health with a concentration in Population and Family Health and a certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Health Data Science. In addition, I have a degree in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology from UCLA. I aspire to use the power of data and my enthusiasm for biology to solve complex problems in healthcare and biopharmaceuticals to improve access to healthcare.
